v0.3.0
    - now merges new data with old data, where there's no change in stats/loadout/skill/etc
        - also fixes mining/harvesting, which would always shit the entire header into storage for every single item collected (not good)
    - add pretty print toggle (doubles file size...)

v0.2.0
    - modified output, now logs data for each individual item as it's collected
    - add more data about logged items (IOU state)
    - add target entity data

v0.1.0
    - initial trial, level 1 -> 40 forestry
    - collecting duration and items collected over a skilling instance (few seconds to a few mins) for each datapoint
    - worked fine, but data collected was shitty and not useful
        - trailing time where nothing was collected was still logged, and threw off averages
        - averaging time per item was effectively random in the trial
        - not fit for purpose!!! change needed
