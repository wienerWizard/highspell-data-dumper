- add playername to header?
    - has no effect on data, just for user reference

- reorganise shit so the data is like
    header: {skillName, level, loadout, etc},
    itemsReceived: {logs: {1,2,3} etc}
- not sure if this would be good to break backwards compatability just yet. maybe another day when there's a need for it

- make some kind of data compressor?
    - takes in a few sequential files and condenses the loosies from the old version
    - no effect on data collected. not worth doing unless other changes require changing the format of saved data

- probably need to do some bullshit to make it work with crime

- test other skills
    - fishing
        - two vars: level, fish type
        - fishing rod does apparently affect the number of rare items you get, according to Dew
        - do we know which fishing type we're at just from the target? or will we have to infer from the items collected?
            - i don't like inference!!
    - mining
        - three vars: level, pickaxe type, rock type
    - harvesting
        - three vars: level, glove type, plant type
    - crime
        - two vars: level, npc
        - different mechanics than other skills, need to test
